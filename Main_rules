# Ownership rules:
* Each value in Rust has a owner.
* There can be only one owner.
* Once owner goes out of scope the value is deleted.

# Reference Rules:
* There can be only one mutable refernce to any data.
* There can be 2 or more immutable references, but there can't be a mutable reference type to prevent race conditions.
